			<p>Our figures include the postseason and are net of revenue sharing and stadium debt payments for which the team is responsible. Revenues include the prorated upfront bonuses networks pay teams as well as proceeds from non-MLB events at the ballpark. Ownership stakes in regional sports networks, as well as related profits or losses, were excluded from our valuations and operating results. Sources include sports bankers, public documents like leases and filings related to public bonds and media rights</p>

			<p>Using last year’s estimates from Forbes, and reapplying the same assumptions outlined above, a 50% revenue sharing agreement would effectively amount to a 41% pay cut for the players. Essentially, the plan would shift two-thirds of the owners’ projected loss to the players, allowing the teams to lower their operating loss to around $600 million. It would also allow the owners to benefit fully from slashing other expenses. In fact, by cutting all non-payroll expenses by 30% (some of which would come naturally as a result of not hosting fans and having limited travel), MLB teams could actually turn a profit if the players agreed to such a drastic reduction in their compensation.</p>

			<p>As defined by Article XXIV of the CBA, the basis for the revenue sharing plan is a percentage of each team’s “Net Local Revenue”, which is basically the money a team makes in its local market (mostly ballpark and media related receipts) minus the cost of stadium expenses, including debt service. Also excluded from this total are distributions from the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund as well as post season revenue. After making all required deductions, what remains is net local revenue. However, the formula for the plan is not as simple as multiplying this figure by a constant rate. Rather, each team’s contribution to or receipt from the plan involves a multi-pronged</p>
